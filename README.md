# Advent of Code
My solutions to the Advent of Code problems. This code is not necessarily representative of my programming skills; if I like a problem I will tend to put more time in it and otherwise a quick and dirty (often inefficient solution) will be good enough for me.
Scripts expect the input files to be in the working directory.
